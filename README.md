Udacity Neighborhood Map Project - By: Vincent Chang

    I created an interactive map of poker rooms located on the Vegas Strip.
    Clicking on each marker will animate said marker and open an info window containing
    important information about each casino. In the future I would like to have the user
    input their location or have the device get the location and populate a map
    with nearby casinos. I used Google Maps API and Foursquare API.

Getting Started

    All you need to do in order to use this webapp is download the repository and
    open index.html. Once you have the app open, you can click on a marker or
    a casino displayed in the list on the left to open/close the info window. There
    is also a filter that you may use on the list.

    Happy Gambling!
